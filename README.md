## PROJECT NAME:

Snapchat Ads Targeting Data Analysis Using SQl and Tableau

## ABOUT PROJECT:

    •	Performed how Snapchat, a social media app Targets its audience for ads - A Data Analysis project.

    •	Performed Data cleaning in MS Excel and used SQl for better Data Analysis Process.

    •	Developed a Tableau dashboard to perform analysis, producing quantitative visualizations 
            in Tableau to draw valuable insights based on how Snapchat targets its audience based on 
            different factors and how big events has big impacts on social media uses.
            
## ABOUT SNAPCHAT: 

    •  Snapchat is an American multimedia instant messaging app and service developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc. 
       One of the principal features of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are usually only available for a short time 
       before they become inaccessible to their recipients.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED:

    •	Advance Excel

    •	MySQL | SQL Server

    •	Tableau

    •	Statistics

## STEPS:

    • Data subset collected from online.
    • Loading Libraries
    • Data Cleaning & Finding Missing values
    • Data Visualization
    
 
## DATA VISUALIZATION:

    1) Vertical Bar Graph of Sum of Total number of Ads for each Country

    2) Boxes of Total Countries, Total Impressions and Total Amount Spent on Ads

    3) Donut Graph of Ads Targeting depending on Different factor contains Age, segments, language, Interests, gender and other factors

    4) Each Donut Graph contains its Own Graph when you hover over it.

    5) line Graph of when they are targeting you

    6) Bar Graph of Total Impression vs Money spend by companies on Ads.

    7) Slop Graph of money spend on each country for advertisement from 2018 to 2019.

## METHODOLOGY:

The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data. I have created three multiple bar Graphs 
which shows different relations between different factors. I have created five Donut graph which has its own Graphs when you Hover over it. One line Graph and One slop Graph for showing visualization.

## DASHBOARD CONTAINS:

    1) Total 3 Bar Graphs Used in the process which are present in Dashboard.

    2) Total 5 Donut Graphs Used in the process which are present in Dashboard. Each donut graph has its own graph which has its own importance in analysis.

    3) Here 1 line Graphs and 1 Slop Graph Used in the process which are present in Dashboard.

    4) If you Hover over the Donut Graphs in Dashborad it shows its own graph which explain it characteristics. It is good way to show More in Less.

## SNAPCHAT ADS ANALYSIS DASHBOARD:

The dashboard shows:

   1) The User can see which country has most number of ads and which country has least.
   2) The Dashboard will provide interactive interface of list of factors on which Snapchat Ads most and least depend upon.
   3) The Dashboard will show how different events shape the Ads targeting based on user.
   4) The Dashboard can compair two counties based on how much money spent on them by different top 5 companies.
   5) The Dashboard will show the money spent on different countries from 2018 to 2019.

### The Following Image shows different Donut Graphs Individual Graphs.

## FINDING:

1) For the 5 countries in which snapchat ads are more popular, Each country experiences an INCREASE 
   in the number of active ads before a Major Political Elections.
2) Of the 29 countries in this dataset, only Denmark and Iraq have shown a decrease in spending on snapchat 
   ads whilst all the other countries have shown an increase in spending.
3) The younger generation must be particularly careful on the influence we allow political ads to have on our decisions. 
   As an 18 year old, 75% of these ads are targeting you and some ads are targeting individuals as young as 14 years old.
4) We should also be more mindful of the influence advertisements may have on us as we reach election dates to ensure we 
   are not influenced by biased ads, the same way we try and avoid being influenced by biased news sources.


## NOTE:
I was going to do Dashboard color in all black and slides colors blue and grey but I though why not use Snapchat's theme
which is yellow and white, So I did it. But below i have included Blue and Grey Dashboard Prototype. Tell me what 
do you think which one is Good.

I have uploaded all the files, datasets, workbook, icons above. Feel free to use this Project's resourses for your next Project. If you like this Project and Dashboard give it a Star or just tell me. It'll make me feel Good :)
